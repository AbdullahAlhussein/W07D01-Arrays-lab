# Lab Arrays 

## Task1: Grades 

Follow these steps:
* Create a new file called grades.java

* Create an array called ‘myTestResults’ that stores a list of results out of 100 that you have scored for 5 fictitious tests that you have written in a fictitious class.

* Write the code that will calculate the average grade based on the results in my ‘myTestResults’. For example, the average grade based on the values in the example above would be: Average = (40 + 60 + 80 + 80 + 85)/5;

* Based on the average grade, decide which letter symbol should be
assigned. Use the table below:

| Average percentage | Letter symbol |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| 80 - 100 | A |
| 70 - 79 | B |
| 60 - 69 | C |
| 50 - 59 | D |
| 49 or less | F |

# Task2: identical arrays 
Follow these steps:
* Create a new file called identicalArrays.java

* Write a program that determines whether two arrays are identical.

* Ask the user to enter a number of integer values and store them in an array

* Then ask the user to enter a second set of integer values and store them in a different array.

* Now determine whether the two arrays are identical.

* If they are identical print out, “The two arrays are identical”

* If they are not identical print out, “The two arrays are not identical”
